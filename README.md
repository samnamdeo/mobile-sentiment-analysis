# Mobile-brands-sentiment-analysis
Sentiment analysis of the text data available on the web either in the form of blogs or at social media sites such as Twitter,
Facebook, and LinkedIn, offers information through which to assess people's perspective of products and services that are of 
interest to them. Consumers routinely scour the Internet to assess other user's reviews for a product or a service before making 
their own decision. Likewise, these same data can potentially provide businesses a snapshot in time of the user's response to their 
products/services and even the trends over time. This information gained through sentiment analysis can then be used by businesses 
to make decisions about improving their products and services, and gain an increased edge over their competitors.

This project examines the tweets about five popular smartphone brands: Iphone, Lenovo, Micromax, Motorola and Samsung. It analyzes the trends of the users that tweeted these brands online, and the topics associated with each brand.
